# GeekShop - Stream 3 - Full Stack Development

## Deployment

This project is deployed at Heroku here https://geekstuff.herokuapp.com/. 

## About 

GeekShop is an ecommerce/blog site allowing users to register/login buy products through paypal and comment on blog topics. To view the products a user must register first. To buy products a user must have a PayPal account. This is of course a test store. The blog page has several topics and is set up with https://disqus.com/ allowing users to comment. The contact page has an interactive google map feature. Also on the contact page if a user enters an email and pushes submit a HTML file message will be sent to the email. 

## Design

The design is the weakest part of the project. The main part of the design is to push users to register to the site.
