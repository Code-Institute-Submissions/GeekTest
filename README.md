# GeekShop - Stream 3 - Full Stack Development

## Deployment

This project is deployed at Heroku here https://geekstuff.herokuapp.com/. 

## About 

GeekShop is an ecommerce/blog site allowing users to register/login buy products through paypal and comment on blog topics. To view the products a user must register first. To buy products a user must have a PayPal account. This is of course a test store. The blog page has several topics and is set up with https://disqus.com/ allowing users to comment. The contact page has an interactive google map feature. Also on the contact page if a user enters an email and pushes submit a HTML file message will be sent to the email. 

## Design

The design is the weakest part of the project. The main part of the design is to push users to register to the site. 

## Tech Used

- Django
- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- JQuery

## Issues Faced

- Understanding the complexity of Django the Models, Template structure and views. 

- Getting the Email on the conatct page set up. This took alot of trial and error locking me out of a couple of email addresses in the process. 

- Deploying to heroku. This process took longer then i would have liked, in hindsight I should have deployed first instead of last. 

- Getting images on the products page. 

## Issues still to finish

A better more eye catching design. More interactive site.
